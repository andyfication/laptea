## Introduction

> LapTea is a usb tea infuser which lets you perfectly infuse tea bags while sitting in front of your laptop. The app has up to three different infusion times according to the type of tea chosen; black, green or herbal. Plug in the LapTea usb cable, launch the desktop app, select your tea type and enjoy your hot drink. When the infusion time is over, LapTea will slowly lift the tea bag out of your cup.
